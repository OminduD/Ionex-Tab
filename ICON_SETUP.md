# Icon Conversion

The icon provided is a modern gradient design. We need to:
1. Save it as icon files for the extension
2. Update manifest to use the icon

Since I cannot directly convert the image, you'll need to:

1. Save the icon image to `public/` folder as:
   - icon16.png (16x16)
   - icon48.png (48x48)
   - icon128.png (128x128)

2. Or use an online converter like:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - Upload your gradient icon image
   - Download all sizes

The icon will then be referenced in the manifest.json files.
